# Web Interface Guidelines

Concise rules for building accessible, fast, delightful UIs. From [Vercel's Web Interface Guidelines](https://vercel.com/design/guidelines). Use MUST/SHOULD/NEVER to guide decisions.

## Interactions

### Keyboard

- MUST: Full keyboard support per [WAI-ARIA APG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
- MUST: Visible focus rings (`:focus-visible`; group with `:focus-within`)
- MUST: Manage focus (trap, move, and return) per APG patterns

### Targets & input

- MUST: Hit target ≥24px (mobile ≥44px). If visual <24px, expand hit area
- MUST: Mobile `<input>` font-size ≥16px or set `maximum-scale=1` in viewport meta
- NEVER: Disable browser zoom
- MUST: `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom

### Inputs & forms

- MUST: Hydration-safe inputs (no lost focus/value)
- NEVER: Block paste in `<input>/<textarea>`
- MUST: Loading buttons show spinner and keep original label
- MUST: Enter submits focused text input. In `<textarea>`, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter submits
- MUST: Keep submit enabled until request starts; then disable, show spinner, use idempotency key
- MUST: Don't block typing; accept free text and validate after
- MUST: Allow submitting incomplete forms to surface validation
- MUST: Errors inline next to fields; on submit, focus first error
- MUST: `autocomplete` + meaningful `name`; correct `type` and `inputmode`
- SHOULD: Disable spellcheck for emails/codes/usernames
- SHOULD: Placeholders end with ellipsis and show example pattern
- MUST: Warn on unsaved changes before navigation
- MUST: Compatible with password managers & 2FA; allow pasting one-time codes
- MUST: Trim values to handle text expansion trailing spaces
- MUST: No dead zones on checkboxes/radios; label+control share one generous hit target

### State & navigation

- MUST: URL reflects state (deep-link filters/tabs/pagination/expanded panels)
- MUST: Back/Forward restores scroll
- MUST: Links are links—use `<a>/<Link>` for navigation (support Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click)

### Feedback

- SHOULD: Optimistic UI; reconcile on response; on failure show error and rollback or offer Undo
- MUST: Confirm destructive actions or provide Undo window
- MUST: Use polite `aria-live` for toasts/inline validation
- SHOULD: Ellipsis (`…`) for options that open follow-ups (e.g., "Rename…")

### Touch/drag/scroll

- MUST: Design forgiving interactions (generous targets, clear affordances)
- MUST: Delay first tooltip in a group; subsequent peers no delay
- MUST: Intentional `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers
- MUST: During drag, disable text selection and set `inert` on dragged element/containers
- MUST: No "dead-looking" interactive zones—if it looks clickable, it is

### Autofocus

- SHOULD: Autofocus on desktop when there's a single primary input; rarely on mobile

## Animation

- MUST: Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (provide reduced variant)
- SHOULD: Prefer CSS > Web Animations API > JS libraries
- MUST: Animate compositor-friendly props (`transform`, `opacity`); avoid layout props
- SHOULD: Animate only to clarify cause/effect or add deliberate delight
- MUST: Animations are interruptible and input-driven (avoid autoplay)
- MUST: Correct `transform-origin` (motion starts where it "physically" should)

## Layout

- SHOULD: Optical alignment; adjust by ±1px when perception beats geometry
- MUST: Deliberate alignment to grid/baseline/edges/optical centers
- SHOULD: Balance icon/text lockups (stroke/weight/size/spacing/color)
- MUST: Verify mobile, laptop, ultra-wide (simulate ultra-wide at 50% zoom)
- MUST: Respect safe areas (use `env(safe-area-inset-*)`)
- MUST: Avoid unwanted scrollbars; fix overflows

## Content & Accessibility

- SHOULD: Inline help first; tooltips last resort
- MUST: Skeletons mirror final content to avoid layout shift
- MUST: `<title>` matches current context
- MUST: No dead ends; always offer next step/recovery
- MUST: Design empty/sparse/dense/error states
- SHOULD: Curly quotes (" "); avoid widows/orphans
- MUST: Tabular numbers for comparisons (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`)
- MUST: Redundant status cues (not color-only); icons have text labels
- MUST: Don't ship the schema—visuals may omit labels but accessible names still exist
- MUST: Use the ellipsis character `…` (not `...`)
- MUST: `scroll-margin-top` on headings for anchored links; include "Skip to content" link
- MUST: Resilient to user-generated content (short/avg/very long)
- MUST: Locale-aware dates/times/numbers/currency
- MUST: Accurate names (`aria-label`), decorative elements `aria-hidden`
- MUST: Icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label`
- MUST: Prefer native semantics (`button`, `a`, `label`, `table`) before ARIA
- MUST: Use non-breaking spaces to glue terms: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;+&nbsp;K`

## Performance

- SHOULD: Test iOS Low Power Mode and macOS Safari
- MUST: Measure reliably (disable extensions that skew runtime)
- MUST: Track and minimize re-renders (React DevTools/React Scan)
- MUST: Profile with CPU/network throttling
- MUST: Batch layout reads/writes; avoid unnecessary reflows/repaints
- MUST: Mutations (`POST/PATCH/DELETE`) target <500 ms
- SHOULD: Prefer uncontrolled inputs; make controlled loops cheap
- MUST: Virtualize large lists
- MUST: Preload only above-the-fold images; lazy-load the rest
- MUST: Prevent CLS from images (explicit dimensions or reserved space)

## Design

- SHOULD: Layered shadows (ambient + direct)
- SHOULD: Crisp edges via semi-transparent borders + shadows
- SHOULD: Nested radii: child ≤ parent; concentric
- SHOULD: Hue consistency: tint borders/shadows/text toward bg hue
- MUST: Accessible charts (color-blind-friendly palettes)
- MUST: Meet contrast—prefer APCA over WCAG 2
- MUST: Increase contrast on `:hover/:active/:focus`
- SHOULD: Match browser UI to bg
- SHOULD: Avoid gradient banding (use masks when needed)
