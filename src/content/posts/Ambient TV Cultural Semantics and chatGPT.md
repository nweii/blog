[Kyle Chayka on the rise of "Ambient TV"](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/emily-in-paris-and-the-rise-of-ambient-tv):
<blockquote class="quoteback" cite="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/emily-in-paris-and-the-rise-of-ambient-tv" data-author="Kyle Chayka for The New Yorker" data-title="‘Emily in Paris’ and the Rise of Ambient TV">
“Ambient” denotes something that you don’t have to pay attention to in order to enjoy but which is still seductive enough to be compelling if you choose to do so momentarily... “Emily in Paris” is soothing, slow, and relatively monotonous... The shows are functionally screen savers, never demanding your attention; they do draw it, but only as much as a tabletop bouquet of flowers.  

[…] TikTok is an app for ambience.

[Zadie Smith on generational differences in *Tar*](https://archive.is/gsGD3):
<blockquote class="quoteback" cite="https://archive.is/gsGD3" data-author="Zadie Smith for The New York Review of Books" data-title="The Instrumentalist | Zadie Smith">[…] if you grew up online, the negative attributes of individual humans are immediately disqualifying. The very phrase ad hominem has been rendered obsolete... Online a person is the position they’re maintaining and vice versa. Opinions are identities and identities are opinions. Unfollow!  
	
Every generation makes new rules... But though there may be no permanent transformations in our emotional lives, there can be genuine reframings and new language... to name and/or penalize the ways we tend to hurt each other.</blockquote>

[Ted Chiang on why ChatGPT is like a "blurry JPEG" of the web](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web):
<blockquote class="quoteback" cite="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web" data-author="Ted Chiang for The New Yorker" data-title="ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web">When an image program is displaying a photo and has to reconstruct a pixel... it looks at the nearby pixels and calculates the average. This is what ChatGPT does... it is taking two points in “lexical space” and generating the text that would occupy the location between them […] [Users have] discovered a “blur” tool for paragraphs instead of photos.
	
In human students, rote memorization isn’t an indicator of genuine learning... When we’re dealing with sequences of words, lossy compression looks smarter than lossless compression. […] The more that text generated by large language models gets published on the Web, the more the Web becomes a blurrier version of itself.</blockquote>

There's a thread here that we're losing the texture that makes things interesting. Whether it's shows designed to be background noise, online discourse that collapses people into their opinions, or AI that averages out human writing into a blur, the result is a much flatter version of the world.
