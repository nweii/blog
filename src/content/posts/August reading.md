## Public life

- **[Digital Public Infrastructure](https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2021/01/05/to-thrive-our-democracy-needs-digital-public-infrastructure-455061)**: What if we built social spaces with taxpayer dollars and civic goals, rather than letting a few companies run everything for profit? Ethan Zuckerman's [FAQ on the topic](https://www.journalismliberty.org/publications/what-is-digital-public-infrastructure) is a great primer.
- **[My Tinder Decade](https://www.thecut.com/article/dating-apps-relationship.html)**: Allison P. Davis on the weird contradiction of dating apps: people go there to find sacred, traditional love in a container that intentionally removes the sacredness.
- **[Conversational Doorknobs](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/good-conversations-have-lots-of-doorknobs)**: Adam Mastroianni on why some conversations take off and others don't. Good partners give you "doorknobs"—little bits of self-disclosure you can grab onto to move the talk forward.

## Industry shifts

- **[Mindless Megamergers](https://www.techdirt.com/2022/08/24/hbo-max-and-sesame-street-highlight-the-stupidity-of-mindless-media-megamergers/)**: Karl Bode on why HBO Max is culling its own content (like *Sesame Street*) just to avoid paying residuals. It's "growth for growth’s sake" at its most pointless.
- **[MBA-style management in Hollywood](https://twitter.com/StLKirk/status/156356287375831449)**: A screenwriter on how a lack of "car guys"—people who actually care about the product—is eroding the movie industry from within.
- **[The Aesthetics of Public Apology](https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/columns/aesthetics-public-apology-brands-wrong-1202692238/)**: Why Instagram "Notes app apologies" feel so hollow. There's nothing sincere about an excuse crafted to look pretty on a grid.
- **[Greenwashing](https://garden3d.substack.com/p/greenwashing-certified)**: How corporate sustainability work often becomes just another marketable feature to pander to consumers.

## Design and games

- **[Optimizing For Feelings](https://browsercompany.substack.com/p/optimizing-for-feelings)**: If software is to have soul, it must feel more like the world around it. We surround ourselves with objects because of how they make us feel, not just what they "do."
- **[The Most Satisfying Checkbox](https://www.andy.works/words/the-most-satisfying-checkbox)**: Digital products are trapped behind glass. To make them feel real, we have to add back the things the screen takes away: animation, sound, and haptics.
- **[How Video Games Inspire UX](https://jenson.org/games/)**: "Fun is just another word for learning." Games are great at teaching skills in layers, something most app design ignores.
- **[Design for Emergence](https://rhizomerd.substack.com/p/when-to-design-for-emergence)**: Kasey Klimes on designing tools that give users the agency to solve their own problems in ways the designer never anticipate:
