[Tangle on the "Inflation Reduction Act"](https://www.readtangle.com/inflation-reduction-act/):

<p>[…] The image of a super-IRS going after wealthy corporations... is not the reality. Instead, the IRS usually spends its money where it is most efficient: Auditing the middle class and the most economically vulnerable taxpayers who can't afford teams of lawyers... More than 4 in 10 of its audits in 2021 targeted recipients of the earned income tax credit.</p>
<p>[…] The bill is a climate change and health care bill with very clear direct tax hikes on profitable corporations to offset the spending. It will almost certainly reduce emissions... drug prices for Medicare recipients... will probably come down. Health insurance prices... may go up for others, depending on how private insurers react.</p>

The bill's success depends on whether the IRS and private companies follow through. They can either absorb the new costs or pass them down to the people the bill was meant to help. It’ll be interesting to see who actually pays the bill in the end.
