title: Dating and hiring feel similar
description: How dating and hiring platforms both rely on reductive keyword matching that fails to capture underlying needs, and whether AI could enable more nuanced people-matching that addresses emotional realities.

I was talking with a friend about the overlaps I see between dating apps and job platforms. We'd just heard a pitch from a founder building AI-powered skill assessments for hiring. Good solution to a real problem, but I felt a bit deflated watching another startup cater to the hirers' triaging workflows.

I think there's a lot being left on the table with regard to the emotional space of people seeking. The problems around how to represent yourself/how to signal your appeal or X-factor feel more profound than problems about managing huge applicant pools. And there's something civically motivating about how the same problem shows up on both sides of seeking/accepting dynamics: _How can I enable the right people to find me?_ and _How can I make myself known to the right people?_

You sometimes see job descriptions that list out all their qualifiers—8 years of experience and such—and then say something like _"…if you don't meet any of this, still reach out anyway."_ They say that because they know criteria only help up to a point. We lean on metrics and static signifiers in lieu of more dynamic ways to convey value through matching systems.

Metrics and hard requirements are proxies for something harder to articulate. You might want to date tall people because you want the _sense of capability_ you associate with height. You might want an artist or a poet, though the underlying qualities that draw you to them aren't exclusive to those people. By filtering for tall poets—or for job applicants who've already done the exact thing you're hiring for—you miss richer ways people could meet your needs. Traditional systems force a shape-fitting paradigm[^1]—[reducing complex qualities to flat attributes](https://nathancheng.fyi/02-Evergreen/Keyword+matching+reduces+complex+qualities+to+flat+attributes)—and this pressures people to self-present in ways that don't guarantee actual fit.

After qualifications and criteria are cleared, any matching decision ultimately comes down to vibes… the fuzzier, harder-to-articulate signals that the criteria only sketched around.[^2] The hiring manager or the dater needs someone who fills a particular gap and creates a particular feeling. Current matching systems don't really touch this emotional space, but it's where real compatibility lives and struggles to express itself.

AI matching using sophisticated [vector embeddings](https://medium.com/kx-systems/vector-embedding-101-the-new-building-blocks-for-generative-ai-a5f598a806ba) holds some promise, but it risks being a more complex form of shape-fitting; you'd plug in keywords, and the system finds things _closer_ to those keywords. A more novel direction might bypass the keyword step entirely: matching signal to signal, letting the fuzzy things find each other directly without forcing them through structured descriptions first. A better north star might be [curiosity-driven connection](https://nathancheng.fyi/02-Evergreen/Curiosity-driven+connection+supports+emergent+fit+over+pre-defined+criteria) rather than just "better matching" (finding the shape faster). Instead of assuming the seeker knows exactly what they want, a more curiosity-driven system would allow for emergent fit, acknowledging that:

- Shapes are lossy at best and reductive at worst. We tend to think of shapes first, then look for people to match them.
- Discovery can shift criteria. The "perfect match" can change your understanding of what you needed in the first place.
- Moving toward signal-based matching also shifts incentives away from pressuring people to fit themselves into static shapes.

What could power this emergent fit? I keep thinking about ambient signals—something like [digital pheromones](https://nathancheng.fyi/02-Evergreen/Napkins/How+might+digital+pheromones+reshape+social+discovery+and+ambient+awareness%3F) that allow for serendipitous stumbles into people with compatible vibes. Or matching that values the _energy_ of someone's interests over the _content_—because [connection often stems from sharing one's world, not just overlapping taste](https://nathancheng.fyi/02-Evergreen/Enthusiasm+exchange+is+a+better+relationship-matching+catalyst+than+shared+taste).

[^1]: Kate Wagner's [piece on platform exhaustion](https://www.late-review.com/p/what-the-fuck-are-we-doing-anymore) comes to mind—the way digital systems compel us to keep reshaping ourselves to work for _them_.
[^2]: This parallels how designers and artists get overlooked in fast-moving early startups. It seems logical to queue design and polish after instrumental necessities like functionality and data infrastructure. But people don't like using ugly or unintuitive things. At best, it's like those shitty healthcare web portals where necessity forces you to spend time with something unharmonious. Vibes reduced to an afterthought—when really they have make-or-break stakes.
