I originally planned to post here twice a month, but that didn't happen. A few reasons why:
- **The "Originality" Burden.** Feeling like everything needs to be a substantial, groundbreaking essay.
- **Perfectionism.** Agonizing over every sentence until the impulse to share it dies.
- **Workflow Friction.** Since this blog is just a series of git commits, it’s a lot more work than tweeting.

I'm not going to fix the workflow anytime soon, but I can fix the first two points by remembering why I started this in the first place. This [post by Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/) was a big influence:

<blockquote class="quoteback" cite="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/" data-author="Alexey Guzey" data-title="Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now">
<p>Consider a university professor teaching a course. Does she say anything original? Do you think she should cancel her course because somebody else discovered the things she wants to teach?</p>
<p>Or consider yourself. Do you avoid having conversations with your friends when you think you have nothing original to say? Do you share things with them? Do you give advice? Do you help to understand things?</p>
</blockquote>

[Chia Amisola](https://write-yourself-in.blogspot.com/2022/11/reasons-to-blog.html) also argues for a more casual, self-centered approach:

<blockquote class="quoteback" cite="https://write-yourself-in.blogspot.com/2022/11/reasons-to-blog.html" data-author="Chia Amisola for Developh" data-title="A blog about blogging ✿ reasons to blog">
<p>[…] worry less about audience and the 'worth' of publishing something – blogging <b>is an act for yourself</b>... a blog doesn't ever have to be finished... it doesn't only have to contain your own words... it doesn't have to be consistent.</p>
</blockquote>

I wanted a space that was entirely my own—away from algorithmic feeds and the constant pressure of social comparison. I'm a digital hoarder and a constant reader; I want to engage better with what I consume and "give back" to the internet that raised me.
