I love how Wikipedia's network of pages is so dense that you can "[hyperlink-hop](https://www.clemesha.org/work/the-wiki-game/)" to nearly any page from another. There must be a word for the specific pleasure of having 20+ tabs open while going down a rabbit hole.

Spending so much time on Wikipedia as a kid made me more curious about how things connect. [WIRED’s deep dive](https://www.wired.com/story/wikipedia-online-encyclopedia-best-place-internet/) calls it the "last best place on the internet":

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Wikipedia%20Is%20the%20Last%20Best%20Place%20on%20the%20Internet" data-author="Richard Cook @WIRED" cite="https://www.wired.com/story/wikipedia-online-encyclopedia-best-place-internet/">
Like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, it broadcasts user-generated content. Unlike them, it makes its product de-personified, collaborative, and for the general good... It is one of the few remaining places that retains the faintly utopian glow of the early World Wide Web. A free encyclopedia encompassing the whole of human knowledge, written almost entirely by unpaid volunteers: Can you believe <em>that</em> was the one that worked?

It’s one of the few places left where you can find in-depth coverage of almost any topic without ads, paywalls, or fluff.

Fan-made "Wikis" (usually on Fandom.com) lack Wikipedia’s strict objectivity, but they're a fun scaffolding for fans to document their obsessions in obsessive detail. They continue the same spirit of "specialized self-indulgence" that Wikipedia enables:

[…] Wikipedia is built on the personal interests and idiosyncrasies of its contributors... Editors' passions can drive the site deep into inconsequential territory—exhaustive detailing of dozens of different kinds of embroidery software... a brief but moving biographical sketch of Khanzir, the only pig in Afghanistan.
