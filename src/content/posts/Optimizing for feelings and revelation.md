[The Browser Company on “Emotional Design”](https://browsercompany.substack.com/p/optimizing-for-feelings):
<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Optimizing for Feelings" data-author="The Browser Company on Substack" cite="https://browsercompany.substack.com/p/optimizing-for-feelings">
<p>Humor us for a moment and picture your favorite neighborhood restaurant... handmade textile seat cushions, a caramel wood grain throughout, and colorful ornaments dangling from the ceilings. Can you picture yours? Do you feel the warmth and spirit of the place?</p>
<p>A Silicon Valley optimizer might say, “Well, they don’t brew their coffee at exactly 200 degrees. And the seats look a little ratty. And the ceiling ornaments don’t serve any function.”</p>
<p>But we think that’s exactly the point. That these little, hand-crafted touches give our environment its humanity and spirit. In their absence, we’re left with something universal but utterly sterile — a space that may “perfectly” serve our functional needs, but leave our emotional needs in the lurch.</p>
<p>[…] When our software optimizes for numbers alone — no matter the number — it appears doomed to lack a certain spirit, and a certain humanity.</p>
[…] <strong>We wanted to optimize for feelings.</strong></p>

It’s hard to justify "delight" in a spreadsheet. Most commercial design processes prioritize what can be measured (clicks, conversion, time-on-site) because those numbers can be optimized; there's always a clear next move toward a 'solution.' But as Nick Foster notes [here](https://medium.com/@fosta/on-design-thinking-8426ecf328b3), focusing purely on the solution can mean ignoring the elegance of how you got there. Benek Lisefski [lends more to this](https://modus.medium.com/data-driven-design-is-killing-our-instincts-d448d141653d) in saying that relying on data alone has a way of flattening things out:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Data-Driven Design Is Killing Our Instincts" data-author="Benek Lisefski on Medium" cite="https://modus.medium.com/data-driven-design-is-killing-our-instincts-d448d141653d">
<p>… relying on data alone ignores that some goals are difficult to measure... [The commercial design process] creates more generic-looking interfaces that <strong>may perform well in numbers but fall short of appealing to our senses.</strong></p>

I see a similar tension in movies. Martin Scorsese’s [critique of Marvel](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html) is essentially about the same trade-off between a "perfect product" and something with genuine risk:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="I Said Marvel Movies Aren’t Cinema. Let Me Explain." data-author="Martin Scorsese @NYTimes" cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html">
<p>…<strong>Cinema was about revelation — aesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation.</strong>... What’s not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk... The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands... market-researched, audience-tested, vetted, modified, revetted and remodified until they’re ready for consumption.</p>

Massive budgets don't guarantee resonance. [Braden Kowitz at Google Ventures](https://www.wired.com/2013/11/design-world-stop-fighting-over-data-vs-instinct/) mentions a time they chose not to optimize a button purely for attention because they wanted to prioritize trust and quality instead. As Lisefski puts it: "While you’re chasing a 2% increase in conversion rate you may be suffering a 10% decrease in brand trustworthiness."
