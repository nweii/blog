Apple's [Dynamic Island](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/09/apple-debuts-iphone-14-pro-and-iphone-14-pro-max/) is an interesting attempt to "blur the line between hardware and software." It turns a physical cutout into a fluid, interactive UI element.

Former Apple designer Ken Kocienda is [skeptical](https://twitter.com/kocienda/status/1571159782870102017):

<p>I worry that a whole bunch of designer effort is now going to be spent on making blobby wobbly pixels—but for what actual benefit? Making great software is still mostly about delivering useful and meaningful features for people.</p>

But there might be a broader purpose here. If Augmented Reality is the future of interfaces, Apple needs to train us to expect software that interacts with the physical world. The "blobby wobbly pixels" are a form of training for AR, where digital objects will need to feel like they have weight and physics in our actual surroundings.

Early iPhone design used "skeuomorphism"—textures like leather and brushed metal—to signal how to use a touch screen. Buttons looked glossy and protruding because that's what physical buttons looked like. Dynamic Island does something similar for 3D: its life-like fluidity makes digital objects feel more approachable and "real," even when they're just pixels.

Design should usually get out of the way, but there’s a [longing](https://browsercompany.substack.com/p/optimizing-for-feelings) for digital experiences that feel less sterile. Sometimes, a little "blobby" physics is exactly what’s needed to make a flat interface feel human.
